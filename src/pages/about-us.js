    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      We are registered with the FDA as a supplier of medical equipment and face masks.  Our company has been around for over 20 years and has always risen to meet the needs of our customers and our community.  Procuring stock of high-quality, medical grade face masks is no easy task, especially over these past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier this year, we donated most of the masks we secured to local hospitals here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Then, we were able to secure and supply enough inventory for a number of hospitals for now and into the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical community should never have to worry about PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).  We are fortunate and grateful to have worked with so many outstanding people, from manufacturing suppliers to logistical partners to doctors who helped behind the scenes in our quest to provide these basic necessities to those on the front lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supplying hospitals with face masks has allowed the doctors, nurses and medical technicians to focus on their jobs, which is to slow the spread of illnesses and keep us all as safe as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have fulfilled our mission of providing these medical professionals with the masks they desperately needed, it is now time for us to help ensure the general population is protected as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    <br />
    <br />
      OUR NEW MISSION:  
      <br />
      To bring high-quality, medical grade masks to the general public so we can all be healthier as we navigate through this pandemic together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please join us in our efforts as we all move towards a more normalized life.
